"""Tests for NIBE power calculation from phase currents.

Tests the calculate_power_from_currents() method that reads BE1/BE2/BE3
sensors and calculates real power consumption.

Based on Swedish 3-phase electrical standards:
- 400V between phases, 240V phase-to-neutral
- All NIBE heat pumps in Sweden are 3-phase
- Power factor 0.95 (conservative for inverter compressor)
