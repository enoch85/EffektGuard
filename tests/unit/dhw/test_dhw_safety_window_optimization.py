"""Test DHW safety minimum with active window optimization.

Verifies that when DHW is in the 15-30°C safety deferral range during expensive
periods, the system actively finds and schedules heating for the next cheap window
instead of just passively waiting.

Context: User reported at 19.6°C DHW, system was just "waiting" instead of finding
the next cheap 45-minute window to heat.
