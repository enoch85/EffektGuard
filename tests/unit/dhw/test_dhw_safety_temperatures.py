"""Tests for DHW safety temperature adjustments.

Tests the new DHW safety thresholds:
- DHW_SAFETY_CRITICAL = 30°C (always heat, no deferral)
- DHW_SAFETY_MIN = 35°C (can defer if 30-35°C during expensive periods)

This prevents peak billing hits when DHW can safely wait for better prices.

IMPORTANT: DHW heating time considerations:
- Tank heat-up: 1-2 hours (enoch85 research)
- No thermal mass delays like concrete slab UFH
- Must check if price peak occurs within heating window
- Defer heating if peak is coming within 1-2 hours

Based on: git diff showing dhw_optimizer.py changes (lines 266-296)
