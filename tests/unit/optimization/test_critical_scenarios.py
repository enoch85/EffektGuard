✅ Peak Calculation Frequency (4 tests)
   Q: How often do we calculate peaks? Is 15 min too short?
   A: - Coordinator updates: 5 minutes (safe, prevents cycling)
      - Peak recordings: 15 minutes (quarterly periods)
      - Offset changes: Rate limited, gradual (max 3°C per update)
      - Result: Safe for compressor, responsive to Effektavgift

✅ Power Outage Recovery (5 tests)
   Q: How close to peak can we be after outage without hitting limits?
   A: - Warning margin: 1.0 kW (offset -1.0°C)
      - Critical margin: 0.5 kW (offset -2.0°C)
      - Exceeding peak: Immediate protection (offset -3.0°C)
      - Storage persists: Peaks survive restart
      - Nighttime flexibility: 50% weighting allows recovery

✅ Preset Modes (4 tests)
   Q: Test different modes (comfort, auto, eco)
   A: - COMFORT: Tolerance 1-3, tight (±0.4-1.2°C)
      - BALANCED: Tolerance 4-6, moderate (±1.6-2.4°C)
      - ECO: Tolerance 8-10, wide (±3.2-4.0°C)
      - Tolerance affects price layer aggression (0.4x to 1.8x)

✅ Quarter Measurement Timing (3 tests)
   - Correct quarter calculation (0-95)
   - Multiple measurements per quarter handled
   - Aligned with Effektavgift billing

✅ System Robustness (2 tests)
   - Month boundary cleanup
   - Persistent storage

Total: 18 critical scenario tests

Key Findings:
1. ✅ 5-min updates SAFE - Prevents cycling while responsive
2. ✅ 15-min quarters CORRECT - Matches Swedish Effektavgift exactly
3. ✅ Recovery PROTECTED - 0.5/1.0 kW margins provide safety
4. ✅ Modes DIFFERENTIATED - Clear comfort vs savings trade-off
5. ✅ Storage RELIABLE - Survives outages and restarts

System is well-designed for real-world operation!
