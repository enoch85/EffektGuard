## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** This integration controls your heat pump's heating curve offset. While extensively tested and designed with safety-first principles, we are **not responsible** for:
- Heat pump damage or malfunction
- Uncomfortable indoor temperatures
- Increased energy costs
- Any other issues arising from use of this integration

This is experimental software controlling real heating systems. Monitor your system closely, especially during the first weeks. If anything seems wrong, disable the integration immediately.

---

## What It Does

Automatically optimizes your heat pump to minimize electricity costs (spot prices + effect tariff) while maintaining comfort and heat pump health. Continuously adjusts heating curve offset based on prices, peak risk, weather forecasts, and learned building characteristics.

**Lower bills without sacrificing comfort or longevity.**

Currently supports NIBE heat pumps via MyUplink integration, with plans to add support for additional brands in the future.

## Key Features

### üéØ Multi-Layer Optimization Engine
8-layer decision system that balances competing priorities:
- **Safety** (temperature limits) - always enforced
- **Emergency** (thermal debt prevention) - climate-aware DM thresholds
- **Effect tariff** (peak avoidance) - predictive 15-min protection
- **Weather compensation** (mathematical flow temp) - Andr√© K√ºhne + Timbones formulas
- **Weather prediction** (pre-heating) - time-aware cold snap protection
- **Spot price** (cost reduction) - native GE-Spot 15-min integration
- **Learning** (predictive control) - self-tuning thermal model
- **Comfort** (tolerance) - reactive temperature correction

### üåç Global Climate Adaptation
Automatic latitude-based zone detection (Arctic to Mediterranean):
- **Extreme Cold** (66.5¬∞N+): Kiruna, Troms√∏ - DM -800 to -1200 normal
- **Very Cold** (60.5-66.5¬∞N): Lule√•, Ume√• - DM -600 to -1000 normal  
- **Cold** (56-60.5¬∞N): Stockholm, Oslo, Helsinki - DM -450 to -700 normal
- **Moderate Cold** (54.5-56¬∞N): Copenhagen, Malm√∂ - DM -300 to -500 normal
- **Standard** (<54.5¬∞N): Paris, London - DM -200 to -350 normal

**No configuration needed** - uses Home Assistant latitude. DM -1500 absolute maximum enforced globally.

### üß† Self-Learning Capability
Learns your building over 7-14 days:
- **UFH type detection** - concrete slab (6h lag) vs timber (2-3h lag) vs radiators (<1h lag)
- **Thermal mass** - building heat storage capacity (kWh/¬∞C)
- **Heat loss coefficient** - envelope performance (W/¬∞C)
- **Heating efficiency** - system response to offset changes (¬∞C/¬∞C)
- **Weather patterns** - seasonal adaptation with unusual weather detection

Predictive pre-heating uses learned parameters for intelligent load shifting.

### ‚ö° Effect Tariff Optimization
Native 15-minute (quarterly) integration:
- **Top-3 monthly peak tracking** - prevents creating new peaks
- **Predictive peak avoidance** - acts before spikes using temp trends
- **Day/night weighting** - full effect daytime, reduced nighttime
- **Savings calculation** - estimates monthly savings (effect + spot)

Works with any 15-min price source ([GE-Spot](https://github.com/enoch85/ge-spot), Nordpool, Tibber, etc.).

### üå°Ô∏è Weather Compensation (Mathematical)
Physics-based flow temperature optimization:
- **Andr√© K√ºhne formula** - validated across manufacturers (Vaillant, Daikin, NIBE, etc.)
- **Timbones method** - radiator-specific calculations (BS EN442)
- **UFH adjustments** - concrete slab (-8¬∞C), timber (-5¬∞C)
- **Climate-aware margins** - automatic safety headroom by zone

Uses proper heat transfer mathematics to optimize flow temperature beyond standard outdoor temp curves.

### üîí Safety-First Design
Production-ready safety mechanisms:
- **Climate-aware thermal debt** - DM thresholds adapt to outdoor temp + zone
- **Trend-aware damping** - prevents overshoot/undershoot (¬±0.3¬∞C/h detection)
- **Configuration validation** - warns about potentially problematic setups
- **DHW coordination** - prevents thermal debt from hot water cycles
- **Manual override** - services for diagnostic control

## Technical Details

### Decision Aggregation
Weighted average of active layers with critical layer override:
- **Critical layers** (weight ‚â• 1.0): Safety, Emergency, Effect @ peak
- **Advisory layers** (weight < 1.0): Weighted aggregation
- **Emergency always wins** - thermal safety > peak cost protection

### Thermal Debt (Degree Minutes)
Heat deficit tracking used by many heat pumps (NIBE Menu 4.9.3, others may vary):
```
DM = ‚à´(BT25 - S1) dt
```
- **BT25**: Actual flow temperature
- **S1**: Target flow temperature  
- **Negative DM**: Heat deficit (compressor catching up)

Climate-aware thresholds prevent heat pump damage. DM -1500 absolute maximum enforced.

### Price Integration
Native quarterly (15-min) price periods:
- **96 periods/day** - matches effect tariff measurement
- **4-tier classification** - cheap/normal/expensive/peak (percentile-based)
- **Day/night weighting** - full optimization daytime, reduced nighttime
- **Auto-discovery** - finds price entity automatically

### Weather Compensation Math
```python
# Andr√© K√ºhne formula (universal)
TFlow = 2.55 √ó (HC √ó (Tset - Tout))^0.78 + Tset

# Timbones method (radiator-specific)  
TFlow = ((Pin / Pout)^(1/1.3) √ó (DTout / DTin)) √ó (Tset - Tout) + Tset
```
Combined with climate-aware safety margins (0.0-2.5¬∞C by zone).

### Self-Learning Timeline
- **Day 1-3**: Low confidence (0.0-0.3), conservative defaults
- **Day 4-7**: Medium confidence (0.3-0.7), starts using learned params
- **Day 8-14**: High confidence (0.7-1.0), fully optimized
- **Ongoing**: Continuous refinement, seasonal adaptation

672 observations (1 week @ 15-min) minimum for reliable learning.
